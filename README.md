# 2nd-keyboard
ALL of Taran's scripts - (not just for the 2nd keyboard.)

I'm the main video editor for Linus Media Group. We put out 1 or more videos every day, so I had to learn how to work quickly, without sacrificing quality.
These AutoHotKey scripts speed up my workflow significantly. (Mostly for Premiere Pro and Explorer)

I pioneered the concept of using a 2nd keyboard purely for macros, and later, the concept of "wrapping" keystrokes inside of other keystrokes, as a means of massively multiplying the number of unique available keys. Watch the video series here, before you attempt to use those scripts:

To see most of these scripts in action during a real workday, check out my "World's Most Advanced Editing Tutorial" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6ERELse_QY

I know there's a lot of scripts in this repository. Look here to see what launches when I start my computer:

Some of the scripts are #include-d in other scripts. The MAIN script from which most others are run, is this one: https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard/blob/master/ALL%20MULTIPLE%20KEYBOARD%20ASSIGNMENTS.ahk

Some scripts can stand entirely on their own, like this one: https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard/blob/master/Taran's%20Windows%20Mods/WINDOWS%20MOD%20-%20both%20Accelerated%20Scrolling%201.3%20AND%20Cursor%20click%20visualizer.ahk

Please note, I'm not a real programmer (in this lifetime.) My organization can be bad, and my code can be spaghetti-y. I have, however, done extensive commenting... so if you know how to code, it should be pretty easy to figure out what's going on.

Help with this Repo is appreciated, but don't feel bad if I never oficially merge your scripts. I can't trust anything that I haven't fully tested myself, or something with code that I don't recognise or understand. These are my real day-to-day working scripts, so I can't compromise them for anybody. 

Sometimes I put out tutorials on my personal channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/TaranVH/videos ...and sometimes I make "reverse tutorials" where I ask questions instead.
